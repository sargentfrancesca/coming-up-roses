    It is important that you inform me at the time of booking of any health issues or medical conditions I may need to be aware of, including pregnancy. I will then be able to advise you of treatments suitable for you</p>

    <p class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 text-justify">
		Due to travel costs, a minimum treatment cost of Â£10 is required. Exceptions may be made at my own discretion, taking into account location and availability on the day of booking.</p>

		<p class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 text-justify">
		I cover a 7 mile radius of GL16 8LJ free of charge but any distance further than this will incur an additional 50p per mile.</p>

		<p class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 text-justify">
		Please aim to give at least 24 hours notice if you need to cancel so the appointment can be offered to someone else.
		</p>

		<p class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 text-justify">
		Payment can be made by cash, cheque or a valid gift voucher. Unfortunately I am unable to accept card payments, bank transfers or cheques. If the total treatment cost equals less than a redeemable gift voucher in monetary value, the remaining balance will be written as a new gift voucher. Gift vouchers are non refundable and must be redeemed within one year. Please have your gift voucher ready before your appointment.
